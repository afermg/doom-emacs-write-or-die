#+title: Readme

Write or die package I tweaked to increase my motivation when writing my PhD Thesis. If you don't do anything for a bit it starts eating your text. Code based on https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/write-or-die.el. It uses functions exclusive to doom-emacs (https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs).

To install just copy it into your .doom.d folder and add
src_elisp[:exports code]{(load (concat doom-user-dir "local_packages/write-or-die.el"))} to your config file.
